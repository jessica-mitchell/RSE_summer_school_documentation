Documentation content and organization
======================================

How to organise content
-----------------------

-  Documentation should be near the code (or in the code),

   -  Same repository or project space

   -  Documentation should be version controlled tied with software
      releases

   -  For user-facing documentation, start with a :doc:`well-structured
      README <doc_templates/README_template>`

-  Topics should be organised in logical, maintainable groups in
   directory structure



Content accessibility and findability
-------------------------------------

-  Consider who is using your tool/service and what they want to find

-  Documentation should  include clear and logical navigation from various
   topics to related topics.

-  For medium to large projects: a dedicated documentation platform
   should be considered (e.g., Read the Docs)

-  Consider that *every page is page one* (a user can land on any page
   as a starting point and need to find their way to their desired goal)

-  Types of navigation you can include:

     - Table of contents (global across website and local to the page)
     - Breadcrumb trail
     - previous / next buttons
     - 'see also' sections
     - appropriate links within text

-  Include a search bar

-  Descriptive titles and headings (not *Introduction* but *How to do
   X*)

-  Up-to-date links to other relevant pages

Types of documentation content
------------------------------

-  Technical/ Developer documentation

   -  High level documentation

      -  Understand the overall architecture/design (how is the
         tool/service built and why),

      -  Set objectives (what is the aim of the project, what problems
         are trying to be solved),

      -  Implement workflows (how is the tool/service AND the
         documentation built, maintained and deployed, what is expected
         of developers)

   -  Low level documentation (Code comments, docstrings etc)

      -  Explain what the code does,

      -  why code is the way it is, and

      -  how it relates to other parts of the code

   -  Release notes to track relevant changes

-  User facing documentation


   -  Explicit installation instructions including prerequisites

   -  A good explanation to what the tool/service is or does and who its
      for

   -  Useful example(s) of how its used

   -  Deep dives into specific topics: Guides, how-tos, and tutorials

   -  API docs

   -  Glossary

   -  troubleshooting/FAQs

   -  Contact info to ask questions and learn how to contribute

   -  Link to relevant peer-reviewed publication(s) (if relevant)

   -  `Citation info <https://citation-file-format.github.io/>`_
      for this software / service

   -  `License <https://choosealicense.com/>`_ info

   -  Acknowledgments (funders, institutions, etc)



Content development
-------------------

-  Encourage community involvement (create issues, provide feedback,
   contribute directly to documentation etc)

-  Ensure the documentation youâ€™re creating is useful to your user base.
   (Consider the value to the audience if adding new features /
   content).

-  Use subject matter experts (SMEs) to develop content alongside
   developers

-  Use a to help
   develop consistent documentation

-  Ensure documentation is understandable by the main audience (consider
   non-native speakers)

-  Ensure documentation is skimmable and varies in text type (bullet
   lists, paragraphs, tables) and visuals (images, gifs, code blocks,
   graphs etc)

-  Never assume your audience knows what you know

-  Use templates or examples for contributors. This makes it easier to contribute
   content. And the content retains consistent structure.


What should be in a style guide?
--------------------------------

-  There are a ton of existing style guides for software documentation -
   use them as resources and references

-  See also this template :doc:`doc_templates/doc_styleguide_template`

-  Keep it light-weight (use other resources as links for further
   details)

-  The goal of style guide is to provide a single reference point for
   content creation. This helps ensure the documentation remains clear
   and consistent.

-  Focus on important concepts that contributors need to know (what kind
   of formats/language do you use, what standards do you follow?).

-  Provide examples of expected styles
