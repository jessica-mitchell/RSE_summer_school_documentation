   # Contributor guidelines

   ### Start with a friendly greeting!

   >Thank you for considering contributing to <software>. It's people like you that make <software> such a great tool.

    ### Explain what kinds of contributions you are looking for.

    > <software> is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community!
    There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or guides, improving the documentation,
    submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code.


    ### Define expectations

    Tell users what you expect them to do. Tell them what you will do.
    Make sure to provide links to sources or references that might be helpful.

    If you are looking to improve or fix documentation see our Style guide and instructions on building the documentation.

    If you are looking to improve or fix code, see our guidelines for C++.

    >1. Create your own fork of the code
    >2. Do the changes in your fork
    >3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
        * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
        * Sign the Contributor License Agreement.
        * Submit a pull request.


    We will assign reviewers once the Pull request is made, and they will review it as soon as time allows.

    Once reviewers are satisified with your changes, they will only approve your submission
    if there are no conflicts with the main branch and all checks have passed in our CI workflow.


    If you want to report a bug, suggest an improvement, or a feature request. Submit an issue using the issue templates
    provided.
