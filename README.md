# RSE-Documentation

This repository contains resources including templates, examples, and links
for the Workshop on Documentation at the RSE summer school 2024 in Karlsruhe, Germany.


It is intended for the participants so they have access to the discussion topics during the
workshop, as well as afterwards so they can continue their documentation developments.

You can either navigate through the source files in the repo or
click here to see the documentation output on Read the Docs.

There are two main folders:

Most of the files are found in the `source` directory.

The `docs` folder is to show how you would deploy HTML page with GitHub Pages.
In this example, we use RMarkdown for our source. This is separate from the Read the Docs
build.
